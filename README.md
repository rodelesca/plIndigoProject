Student Information Tool:
This program is designed to be able to provide students with their class schedules, with the inclusion of the room number, professor, and how many units a course has. 
The student will input their course (e.g. 1CpE, 1ME), and the student will have an option to view their schedule, units, professors, and designated rooms.
